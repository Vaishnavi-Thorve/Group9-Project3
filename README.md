# Group9-Project3

This project cannot really be devided into different tasks, because we all met and coded together. 

If someone worked on tasks alone, we all reviewed and corrected parts together, so individual parts of the code can rarely be attributed to a single person.

So Yasmin Sheikh Ali, Matt√©o Adrien Debiere, Johanna Seitz and Vaishnavi Dinesh Thorve all contributed something important to the code.
