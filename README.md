# Group9-Project3

this project cannot really be devided into different tasks as we all met up and coded together. 
If someone worked on tasks alone we all reviewed and corrected parts together, so it any part of the code can be rarely be attributed to a single person.

So, Yasmin Sheikh Ali, Matt√©o Adrien Debiere, Johanna Seitz and Vaishnavi Dinesh Thorve all contributed something important to the code.
